# Repository Type: Red Hat Content Delivery Network with RHSM
#==============================================================================

# This script performs PHASE 1: System preparation for upgrade
# After this script completes successfully:
# 1. Run 'leapp preupgrade' to analyze your system
# 2. Review and resolve any issues found
# 3. Run 'leapp upgrade' to perform the actual upgrade  
# 4. System will reboot automatically after upgrade
# 5. Run the POST-UPGRADE script after reboot to complete cleanup

# IMPORTANT SAFETY WARNINGS:
# 1. DO NOT RUN THIS SCRIPT ON PRODUCTION SYSTEMS WITHOUT TESTING FIRST
# 2. ENSURE YOU HAVE A COMPLETE BACKUP OR VM SNAPSHOT BEFORE PROCEEDING
# 3. REVIEW EACH COMMAND BEFORE EXECUTION
# 4. THIS SCRIPT REQUIRES ROOT PRIVILEGES
# 5. SOME STEPS REQUIRE MANUAL INTERVENTION AND CANNOT BE AUTOMATED
